Python For Loops: Takeaways by Dataquest Labs,
•Repeating a process using a for loop:
row_1 = ['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5]
for element in row_1:
print(element) 
•Appending values to a list:
a_list = [1, 2]
a_list.append(3)
•Opening a dataset file and using it to create a list of lists:
opened_file = open('AppleStore.csv')
from csv import readerread_file = reader(opened_file)
apps_data = list(read_file)
•Converting a string to a float:
rating_sum = 0
for row in apps_data[1:]:
    rating = float(row[7])
    rating_sum = rating_sum + rating 
===Concepts===
•We can automate repetitive processes using for loops.
•We always start a for loop with for (like in for element in app_ratings:).
•The indented code in the body gets executed the same number of times as elements in the iterable
variable. If the iterable variable is a list containing three elements,
the indented codein the body gets executed three times. 
We call each code execution an iteration, so there willbe
three iterations for a list that has three elements.
For each iteration, the iteration variablewill take a
different value.
